Logistic Regression model: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic - Machine Learning Project
Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of breast cancer diagnosis using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on various features.
Key Components
Dataset

    Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset: A well-known dataset used for binary classification tasks in the field of medical diagnostics.

Libraries Used

    Algorithm: Logistic Regression model
    Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
    Seaborn: Employed for data visualization to gain insights into the dataset.
    Scikit-Learn (sklearn): Used for implementing machine learning algorithms, including preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Data Preprocessing

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to understand the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.
    Normalization: Applied to scale the features and ensure they contribute equally to the model.

Model Development

    Machine Learning Models: Developed using sklearn modules to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign.

Evaluation

    Model Evaluation: Performed to assess the performance of the developed models using various metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in healthcare, specifically in the diagnosis of breast cancer, using Python and its powerful libraries.
